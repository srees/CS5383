magic_client.py and magic_server.py are pretty straightforward.
Run:
python3 magic_server.py on your server (setup in this repo as locally)
Then run:
python3 magic_client.py on your client (also setup here as localhost)

Use the client to ask a question and the server will return a random Magic 8 response!

I prompted ChatGPT to develop both scripts over a series of four prompts. I explored some further options and ended up returning to this point in the code to keep things simple for this assignment.
